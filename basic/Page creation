To create a basic HTML homepage in django create a "views.py" file in your project directory and past the following:

from django.http import HttpResponse
def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("<h1>Hello, world! Welcome to my home page...</h1>")

Then go to the the 'urls.py' file inside the same project directory and define the home page as follows (use your brain):

from .views import home
    path('', home),

To create a static HTML home page :

1. Create a folder named templates on BASE_DIR aka where manage.py is

2. Create a file inside named ".index.html"
            
3. Create a views.py in the homepage directory and add the following:

 from django.http import HttpResponse
            def index(request):
            return HttpResponse("<h1>This is the home page</h1>")
