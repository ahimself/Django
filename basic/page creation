To create a basic HTML homepage in django create a "views.py" file in your project directory and past the following:

from django.http import HttpResponse

def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("<h1>Hello, world! Welcome to my home page...</h1>")

Then go to the the 'urls.py' file inside the same project directory and define the home page as follows (use your brain):

from .views import home

    path('', home),

To create a static HTML home page:


1. Create an app: python manage.py startapp homepage


2. Add the app to the installed apps in the "settings.py" folder in the project directory:

INSTALLED_APPS = [ 
'Homepage',


3. Specify the path of the home page in the "urls.py" folder in the project directory to redirect users:

urlpatterns = [ 
url(r'^', include ('homepage.urls')),


4. Create a url.py in the homepage directory and add the following: 

 from django.conf.urls import url, include
             from . import views

            urlpatterns = [
            url(r'^$', views.index, name='index'),
            ]
            
5. Create a views.py in the homepage directory and add the following:

 from django.http import HttpResponse

            def index(request):
            return HttpResponse("<h1>This is the home page</h1>")
